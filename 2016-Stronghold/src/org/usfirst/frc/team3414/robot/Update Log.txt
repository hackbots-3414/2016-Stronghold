- In moveAugerToPosition(): add if statements surrounding while loops
- Make shooterAndLauncher override method in launcherWithPistons(): use in the same format as other override modes
- Replace all instances with moveShooterAndAugerToPreset() when available
- Make launcherWithoutPistons.java, from oldAlphaLauncher.java
- Overload the names of the four methods describing moveShooterAndAugerToPreset

- Fix all of the above

- There was no "break" in switch statement for moveShooterToPreset
- Changed EShooter Enum to include all four defenses for autoShot
- Cleaned up AutoShot and AutonLowBarShootHigh, old is commented out, new uses turn right/left
 -> THEN moveShooterAndAugerToPreset; this should be tested before use, just in case
- Created doubles in LauncherWithPistons, so MullenatorTeleop now uses enums
- DriveTrainAssist: Added printlns to make sure what we want is actually happening

	AutonPortcullis, AutonReachDefenses, Fourty Kai, LowBarPreset(Teleop), NormalDefensePreset(Teleop), AutoShot
	* moveShooterAndAugerToPreset FIXED: Uses while{waitmillis(50)}
	* AutoShot and AutonLowBarShootHigh: now is implemented as (turnLeft -> moveShooterAndAugerToPreset);
